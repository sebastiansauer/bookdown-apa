# bookdown-apa
This repo provides an APA-friendly version of the thesisdown/bookdown/markdown template. Primarily, this template is suited for psychology thesis formatting (since psychologists use the APA style).

The examples and some some formatting are suited to the German language.

EARLY DEVELOPMENT!
